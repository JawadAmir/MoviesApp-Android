MovieApp is an Android application written in Kotlin that displays the list of trending movies, when we select one movie it shows more details about it.<br />

This application contains this features: <br/>
  - API consuming with Volley Library<br/>
  - Display movie item with pictures Using Glide library<br/>
  - Multi languages by detecting the language used on the phone and display the application with this language<br/>
  - Management of multiple cases:
   * Loading of the data ( I used Lottie library for the animation view)<br/>
   * The case Where no movie is found<br/>
   * The case where there's an error in data given by the API<br/>
   * The case where the user doesn't have the internet connection<br/>
 - The favorite feature where the user can add a movie to his favorite and display all his favorite movies<br/>
